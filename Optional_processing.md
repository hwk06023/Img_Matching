# Optional processing

## Augmetation + Few shot learning

An attempt to improve performance in [one-shot learning](One_shot_learning.md)(markdown doc link) <br/>

I make use of [paperwithcode's git](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/prototypical-networks-for-few-shot-learning)

#### An attempt (Update)
- Metric based learning - [Prototypical Network](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2017/file/cb8da6767461f2812ae4290eac7cbc42-Paper.pdf), Relation Network, .. <br/>
- Model based learning - .. <br/>
- Optimizer learning - .. <br/>
<br/>

### Augemtation

Flipping, Gray scale, Brightness, Rotation ..

## + Continual learning

Continual learning is required because the task to be processed is constantly updated. <br/>
